# Preamble

![](./img/covid.JPG)

Analysis of the **psychological effects of Covid-19** in Europe during the first weeks of the pandemic. Survey based on this  [project](https://covidistress.github.io) conducted by researchers around the world. Trying to map out all the factors, that might affects people’s psychological wellbeing and their ability to make good decisions during the COVID-19 (or "Coronavirus") outbreak all over the world. Researchers form many countries are collaborating on this project, to help scientists and decision makers to help and communicate.

## Why this project?

The project was chosen as it deals with analyzing all those factors that in this emergency situation can have **serious consequences** in people's lives, as the isolation, the economic situation and the stress due to the stringent measures to stop the pandemic are part of the side effects of covid-19.
The survey on which the next analyzes are based was designed by social scientists and psychologists from more than 50 different universities.
The study in question presents more than 150,000 individual respondents from more than 50 different countries.
The following analyzes describe a series of variables selected in the survey, taking as a sample the responses provided by citizens located in Europe who answered the survey between March 30, 2020 and May 30, 2020.

# Characteristics of the Respondents

As said in the **'Preamble'** this project is focuses on the responses provided by citizens located in Europe's countries.
```{r EU, echo=TRUE}
#filtering by EU Countries
target <- c("Austria","Belgium","Bulgaria","Croatia","Cyprus","Czech Republic",
            "Denmark","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary",
            "Ireland","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Luxembourg","Malta",
            "Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Slovakia","Slovenia",
            "Spain","Sweden")

EU <- filter(cleaned_d, Country %in% target) 

#fixing date visualization
EU$RecordedDate <- as.Date(EU$RecordedDate , format= "%Y-%m-%d")
```

We can see that most respondents are aged **between 20 and 40**.
```{r age, fig.cap="Age of the Respondents", fig.align='center'}
#note: Missing values are omitted
ggplot(subset(EU, !is.na(Dem_age)),aes(Dem_age))+

        axis.text.y = element_text(size=10, hjust = 1))
```

The majority of the answers come from **women**.
```{r gendeer, fig.cap="Gender of the Respondents", fig.align='center'}

          yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE))
```

**Full time employed** lead the survey.

# Stress level in Europe

An important point of the project is based on the analysis of **perceived individual stress**, obtained through the PSS Scale, based on the answers to 10 questions, invented by psychologists Cohen, Karmak, and Mermelstrein (1983), using indicators of stress responses, for instance, perceived lack of control over events, pressure from mounting difficulties and feeling upset about unexpected changes. Scores are considered moderate above 2.4, and high above 3.7.
More infos about **PSS Scale** [here](https://www.midss.org/content/perceived-stress-scale-pss)

PSS scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 & 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items (items 4, 5, 7, & 8) and then summing across all scale items. A short 4 item scale can be made from questions 2, 4, 5 and 10 of the PSS 10 item scale.

```
Levels of stress were **moderate or lower** in many countries. Poland and Croatia reported the highest levels of stress in Europe,and Denmark and the Netherlands the lowest.

## Are men or women more stressed?

```
In fact we can see that **women** results more stressed then men, in line with [this](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-10525-006)
Psychological article, many women also have to think about the housework and the children.

**Student** is the most stressed category, as expected, due to isolation and social distancing;
Poland is the most stressed Nation and in fact in [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532061/)
article we can see that University Students recorded an highly level of stress during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The stress level in the first two weeks **was higher** than the model predicted, 
in the third week it decreased a bit and then increased and repeated 
the cycle until the end of May. Unexpectedly in the end of the May the stress level 
increased again, it is weird because typically with the begginig of summer people should
be less stressed; unfortunately we don't have any data that will confirm this trend.

# Sources of Distress 

Now the analysis will focus on the **cause** of the stress of the respondents, asking them questions regarding various factors that represent a source of stress.

```{r stress source, echo=TRUE}
eu_stress_source <- select(EU, Expl_Distress_1:Expl_Distress_24)%>%
                    na.omit()

eu_stress_source = data.frame(apply(eu_stress_source,2,function(x)mean(x[x<99]))) %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column(var = "col1") %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("stress_source", "mean")) 
 
listlab<-(c("No religious activities", "Not knowing how to stop covid-19",
            "Feeling ashamed for acting differently","Adapt work to Digital Platforms",
            "Access to necessities(food etc..)","Behavior of adults I live with",
            "Behavior of childrens I live with","Adapt to social life on digital platforms",
            "No trovels outside my Country","Loneliness","Time i spend in proximity to others",
            "Children's education","Civil services(Police,sanitations..)","Income",
            "Not knowing about developments with Covid-19","Time I spend inside","Work",
            "Job prospect","No social activities","Worry over friends and relatives who live far away",
            "Not knowing how long the measures will last","Risk of catching covid-19",
            "Risk of being hospedalized or dying","National economy"))
```

```{r stress source plot, fig.cap="Sources of Distress among Europeans during the COVID-19 Pandemic", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(eu_stress_source, aes(reorder(stress_source,mean), mean)) +
  geom_col(fill= "#006978")+
  ylim(0,6)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_economist(dkpanel=TRUE) +
  scale_colour_economist()+
  scale_x_discrete(label  = listlab)+
  labs(y="Mean" )+
  theme(axis.line.y = element_line(size = 0.5), axis.text.x=element_text(size=10),axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.title.x =  element_text(margin = margin(t = 5),hjust = 0.53),
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=8))
```
The results indicate that most respondents are concerned about the state of the **national economy**. Economic considerations were followed closely by health-related risks, such as the risks of being hospitalised and of contracting the new disease.

# Trust in institutions
Partecipants were asked how much they trusted six key **institutions** in relation to the Covid-19 emergency
(on a scale from 1 = not at all to 10 = completely), in particular partecipants were asked about their trust
towards World Health Organization(WHO), the national governments’ efforts to tackle the COVID19, the Police,
the civil service, the national government and the healthcare systems.


[Here](https://www.oecd.org/governance/oecd-guidelines-on-measuring-trust-9789264278219-en.htm) there are **OECD guidelines** on measuring institutions trust.

```{r trust, echo=TRUE}
eu_trust <- select(EU, OECD_insititutions_1:OECD_insititutions_6)%>%
  na.omit()

eu_trust = data.frame(apply(eu_trust,2,function(x)mean(x))) %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column(var = "col1") %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("trust", "mean")) 
lablist<-(c("Country's Governments","Country's civil Service","Country's Police",
            "Governments effort against covid-19","WHO","Country's Healthcare system"))
```

```{r trustplot, fig.cap="Trust in Institutions"}
ggplot(eu_trust, aes(reorder(trust,mean), mean)) +
  geom_col(fill= "#006978")+
  ylim(0,10)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_economist(dkpanel=TRUE) +
  scale_colour_economist()+
 scale_x_discrete(label  = lablist)+
  labs(y="Mean" )+
  theme(axis.line.y = element_line(size = 0.5), axis.text.x=element_text(size=10),axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.title.x =  element_text(margin = margin(t = 5)),
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=8))
```
Europeans reported only **medium** level of trust at all, with the highest levels of trust for their countries’ healthcare system and the WHO.
Notably, Countries governments reported the lowest level of trust.

## How much citizens trust their own governments?
```{r trustoecd1, echo="TRUE"}

eu_mean_oecd1 <- select(EU,Country,OECD_insititutions_1) %>%
  ddply( .(Country), summarize,
         Rate_OECD_insititutions_1=mean(OECD_insititutions_1,na.rm=TRUE))%>%
        arrange(desc( Rate_OECD_insititutions_1))
```

```{r trustoecd1plot, fig.cap="Trust towards governments"}
ggplot(eu_mean_oecd1, aes(reorder(Country,Rate_OECD_insititutions_1),
                          Rate_OECD_insititutions_1 )) +
  geom_col(fill= "#006978")+
  ylim(0,10)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_economist(dkpanel=TRUE) +
  scale_colour_economist()+
  labs(y="Mean")+
  theme(axis.line.y = element_line(size = 0.5), axis.text.x=element_text(size=10),axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.title.x =  element_text(margin = margin(t = 5)),
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=10))
```

Noably, we see that **Poland** is the most stressed Nation but also 
 one of the Country in which the population trust least in their own government
  **Finland**, on the other hand, is the nation with the least stress related to Covid,
 and it is also one of the Nations in which the population trust
 most in their own government.

 ## How much citizens trust the government’s effort to handle the pandemic?
 ```{r trustoecd4, echo="TRUE"}
 
 eu_mean_oecd4 <- select(EU,Country,OECD_insititutions_4) %>%
   ddply( .(Country), summarize,
          Rate_OECD_insititutions_4=mean(OECD_insititutions_4,na.rm=TRUE))%>%
   arrange(desc( Rate_OECD_insititutions_4))
 ```
 
 ```{r trustoecd4plot, fig.cap="Trust towards government’s effort to handle Coronavirus"}
 ggplot(eu_mean_oecd4, aes(reorder(Country,Rate_OECD_insititutions_4),
                           Rate_OECD_insititutions_4 )) +
   geom_col(fill= "#006978")+
   ylim(0,10)+
   coord_flip()+
   theme_economist(dkpanel=TRUE) +
   scale_colour_economist()+
   labs(y="Mean")+
   theme(axis.line.y = element_line(size = 0.5), axis.text.x=element_text(size=10),axis.title.y=element_blank(),
         axis.title.x =  element_text(margin = margin(t = 5)),
         axis.text.y=element_text(size=10))
 ```
 Similar patterns as the trust level in the governments, with **Bulgaria** that reported the lowest level of 
 trust for the national effort to handle the pandemic.
 
# Trust in Countries' Measure
It was also asked participants to judge the **appropriateness
of the countries’ measures** in response to the COVID-19 on a scale from 0 (too little),
to 5 (appropriate, the black dashed line in the graph), to 10 (too much).


```{r trustinc, echo=TRUE}
eu_trustinc <- select(EU,Country,Trust_countrymeasure) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Mean = mean(Trust_countrymeasure, na.rm=TRUE))
```

```{r trustincplot, fig.cap="Appropriateness of the countries’ measures"}
ggplot(eu_trustinc, aes(reorder(Country, Mean), Mean)) +
  geom_col(fill="#006978")+
  ylim(0,8)+
  geom_hline(yintercept=5)+
  coord_flip()+
theme_economist(dkpanel=TRUE) +
  scale_colour_economist()+
  labs(y="Country", x="Mean")+
  theme(axis.line.y = element_line(size = 0.5), axis.text.x=element_text(size=10),
        axis.title.y =  element_text(margin = margin(r = 5)),
        axis.title.x =  element_text(margin = margin(t = 5)),
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=10))
        
```
**Slovakia** and **Slovenia** were those countries where citizens considered the measures stronger than necessary; in the plot, the vertical mid-line indicates that the measures are appropriate.
**France** and **Hungary** citizens judged their governments’response less than appropriate.

### There is correlation between confidence in the measures taken by governments to tackle covid and the actions that the population has taken to reduce transmission?

```{r confcorr, echo=TRUE}
eu_conf_corr <- select(EU,Country,OECD_insititutions_6,Compliance_1:Compliance_6) %>%
                ddply( .(Country), summarize,
         Rate_OECD=mean(OECD_insititutions_6,na.rm=TRUE),
         Rate_Compliance_1=mean(Compliance_1,na.rm=TRUE),
         Rate_Compliance_2=mean(Compliance_2,na.rm=TRUE),
         Rate_Compliance_3=mean(Compliance_3,na.rm=TRUE),
         Rate_Compliance_4=mean(Compliance_4,na.rm=TRUE),
         Rate_Compliance_5=mean(Compliance_5,na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  mutate(total_Compl = rowMeans(select(., -Country,-Rate_OECD)))
```

```{r mod, echo=TRUE}
mod = lm( total_Compl ~Rate_OECD, data = eu_conf_corr)
summary(mod)
mod$coefficients
```

```{r confcorrplot, fig.cap="Trust towards the governments’handling of the pandemic"}
ggplot(eu_conf_corr, aes(Rate_OECD,total_Compl)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = Country),
                   size=2,
                   box.padding   = unit(0.5, "lines"), 
                   point.padding = 0.5,
                   min.segment.length = 0,
                   segment.color = 'grey50') +
  theme_economist(dkpanel=TRUE) +
  scale_colour_economist()+
  labs(y="Mean of Compliances", x="Mean of trust towards governemts efforts")+
  theme(axis.line.y = element_line(size = 0.5), axis.text.x=element_text(size=10),
       axis.title.y =  element_text(margin = margin(r = 5)),
       axis.title.x =  element_text(margin = margin(t = 5)),
       axis.text.y=element_text(size=10))+
  geom_abline(intercept = mod$coefficients[1], 
              slope = mod$coefficients[2], 
              color = "red")
```
From what emerges **Poland** not having confidence in the measures taken
by governments does not even try to reduce transmission,
while **Denmark** is in the opposite situation.
In countries with higher trust towards governments ’efforts, citizens were also more 
likely to report higher levels of compliance with directives aimed at controlling the 
spread of the virus. Notably, **Portugal** reported higher levels of compliance than the model  would predict based on the acceptance of government efforts. An outlier in the other direction, Latvia reported lower levels of compliance than those the model predicted, given levels of trust.

## Will be government’s effort to handle Coronavirus more trusted over the time?
```{r trust2m, echo=TRUE}
eu_trust2m <- select(filter(EU,RecordedDate=="2020-03-30"|
                       RecordedDate=="2020-04-06"|

  ddply( .(RecordedDate), summarize,
         Rate_OECD=mean(OECD_insititutions_6,na.rm=TRUE))
```

```{r trust2mplot, fig.cap="Trust towards the governments’handling of the pandemic over the first weeks"}

        axis.line.y = element_line(size = 0.5),axis.text.y = element_text(size=10,vjust=0.5,hjust = 1.25))

```
In the first month the trust for government’s effort to handle Coronavirus 
appears to increase, due to more stringent measures. But with **beginning of the summer season** Trust level seems to be decreasing,
probably because in many countries, including ours, Italy, the measures were almost null.

# Conclusions

In conclusions, **Student** is the most stressed category, as expected due to isolation and social distancing;
Poland is the most stressed Nation in Europe and in fact in [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532061/)
article we can see that Polish University Students recorded an highly level of stress during the Covid-19 pandemic.
**Women** results more stressed then men, as said in [this](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-10525-006)
Psychological article.
Notably, around the Europe the **Country's healthcare system** is trusted followed by the **WHO**. 
The countries of northern Europe result **less stressed** and trust more in their authority rules to block the pandemic ,on the other side 
est-European countries are **most stressed** and trust less in their governments and in measure taken to handle the pandemic
